# TDT (Tucker-Davis Technologies) Fiber Photometry analysis GUI üêÅ

### Overview

__TDT Fiber Photometry__

The [TDT Fiber Photometry System](https://www.tdt.com/system/fiber-photometry-system/) measures the activity of neurons in rodents using calcium imaging.
These real-time neuronal activity measurements can also be [coupled with behavioural events](https://www.tdt.com/system/behavior-and-fiber-photometry/).
For example, this could be a rodent poking a Feeding Experimentation Device ([FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3)), 
entering the closed arm of an elevated plus maze or reacting to the drop of a peanut butter chip.

TDT, David Root and the Morales lab have created an [analysis code](https://www.tdt.com/docs/sdk/offline-data-analysis/offline-data-python/FibPhoEpocAveraging/#housekeeping) for the raw data from this fiber photometry system. <br>
I will refer to this as the Root code.
* This subtracts the isosbestic (ISOS) signal from the calcium imaging (GCaMP) signal and converts this signal to dFF and baseline Z-Score values.
* It then defines an epoch or a time window around each event (in the example below, 10 secs before and 10 secs after). The mean of these Z-score signals are then averaged across all epochs.

__Purpose__

These codes create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the inputs to the Root code. <br>
They create unique event definitions, direct the Root code to perform various types of analysis and also perform post-processing.
* <ins>Types of analysis</ins>
  * Peri-events: the time around a specific event
  * Peri-events ([FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3)): the time around left nose pokes, right nose pokes and pellet drops
  * Between events: the time between events, such as 2 bottle choice, open field and elevated plus maze tests
  * Whole recording: the entire recording, and annotating any number of events over the top
* <ins>Data types</ins>
  * Notes
  * Video timestamps
  * Other epoch events
  * [EthoVision XT](https://www.noldus.com/ethovision-xt) events
* Export images and create raw data with descriptive statistics
* Create video snippets of events with the neuronal signal traces overlayed
* Create a high-throughput method for analysing many input folders with many settings

__Input data__

TDT fiber photometry systems export recording data into "[tanks](https://www.tdt.com/docs/sdk/offline-data-analysis/tdt-data-storage/)". <br>
A folder like this is the import location to the GUI. <br>
They also contain data with the structure below.

__Output data__

Here is an example output for the peri-events (FED3) analysis. The corresponding export image is created by the Root code, like the image above.
