# TDT (Tucker-Davis Technologies) Fiber Photometry analysis GUI üêÅ

### Overview

__TDT Fiber Photometry__

The [TDT Fiber Photometry System](https://www.tdt.com/system/fiber-photometry-system/) measures the activity of neurons in rodents using calcium imaging.
These real-time neuronal activity measurements can also be [coupled with behavioural events](https://www.tdt.com/system/behavior-and-fiber-photometry/).
For example, this could be a rodent poking a Feeding Experimentation Device ([FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3)), 
entering the closed arm of an elevated plus maze or reacting to the drop of a peanut butter chip.

TDT, David Root and the Morales lab have created an [analysis code](https://www.tdt.com/docs/sdk/offline-data-analysis/offline-data-python/FibPhoEpocAveraging/#housekeeping) for the raw data from this fiber photometry system.
* This subtracts the isosbestic (ISOS) signal from the calcium imaging (GCaMP) signal and converts this signal to dFF and baseline Z-Score values.

__Purpose__

The CSV output from the FED3 devices show the timestamps of each event, like nose pokes or pellet retrievals. This repository :
* Converts this output into a time binned file. It also adds another sheet with the time stamps of all pellet count changes.
* Creates a master file that combines all the ‚ÄúLeft poke count‚Äù columns from the raw FED files into one sheet. It does the same thing for the other column types as well. The columns are then sorted by genotype and treatment. <br>
