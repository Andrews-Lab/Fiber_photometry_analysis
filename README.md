# TDT (Tucker-Davis Technologies) Fiber Photometry Analysis GUI üêÅ

### Overview

__TDT Fiber Photometry__

The [TDT Fiber Photometry System](https://www.tdt.com/system/fiber-photometry-system/) measures the activity of neurons in rodents using calcium imaging.
These real-time neuronal activity measurements can also be [coupled with behavioural events](https://www.tdt.com/system/behavior-and-fiber-photometry/).
For example, this could be a rodent poking a Feeding Experimentation Device ([FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3)), 
entering the closed arm of an elevated plus maze or reacting to the drop of a peanut butter chip.

TDT, David Root and the Morales lab have created an [analysis code](https://www.tdt.com/docs/sdk/offline-data-analysis/offline-data-python/FibPhoEpocAveraging/#housekeeping) for the raw data from this fiber photometry system. <br>
I will refer to this as the Root code.
* This subtracts the isosbestic (ISOS) signal from the calcium imaging (GCaMP) signal and converts this signal to dFF and baseline Z-Score values.
* It then defines an epoch or a time window around each event (in the example below, 10 secs before and 10 secs after). The mean of these Z-score signals are then averaged across all epochs.

__Purpose__

These codes create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the inputs to the Root code. <br>
They create unique event definitions, direct the Root code to perform various types of analysis and also perform post-processing.
* <ins>Types of analysis</ins>
  * Peri-events: the time around a specific event
  * Peri-events ([FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3)): the time around left nose pokes, right nose pokes and pellet drops
  * Between events: the time between events, such as 2 bottle choice, open field and elevated plus maze tests
  * Whole recording: the entire recording, and annotating any number of events over the top
* <ins>Data types</ins>
  * Notes
  * Video timestamps
  * Other epoch events
  * [EthoVision XT](https://www.noldus.com/ethovision-xt) events
* Export images and create raw data with descriptive statistics
* Create video snippets of events with the neuronal signal traces overlayed
* Create a high-throughput method for analysing many input folders with many settings

__Input data__

TDT fiber photometry systems export recording data into "[tanks](https://www.tdt.com/docs/sdk/offline-data-analysis/tdt-data-storage/)". <br>
A folder like this is the import location to the GUI. <br>
They also contain data with the structure below.

__Output data__

Here is an example output for the peri-events (FED3) analysis. The corresponding export image is created by the Root code, like the image above. The peri-events and between events analysis types also have the same output format.

Here is an example export image for the whole recording analysis, with the notes and EthoVision events annotated.

Here is an example video snippet of the air puff event with the Z-Score signal trace below.

__High throughput analysis of TDT tanks__

After every analysis run using the GUI, a settings excel file is exported. These settings can be edited and also duplicated. When this file is re-imported, it can run the analysis for multiple tanks at once. If you set "import subfolders" to TRUE, you can also apply the same analysis to all tanks within one master folder.
